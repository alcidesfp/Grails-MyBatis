Modifications:
 - Some changes in name conventions
 - Added full support for multiple datasources
 - Plugin refactor for Grails 2.0
 - Minimum Grails dependency 2.0.3
 - Added support for optional optimistic locking - based on MyBatis Optimist plugin (http://code.google.com/p/optimist/) while avoiding Java annotations (convention over configuration)
 - Added support for custom Enum persistance (based on enum property value - to make DBA-s happy)
